However, very large models can be quite difficult to train due to memory constraints. In this work, we present our techniques for training very large transformer models and implement a simple, efficient intra-layer model parallel approach that enables training transformer models with billions of parameters. Our approach does not require a new compiler or library changes, is orthogonal and complimentary to pipeline model parallelism, and can be fully implemented with the insertion of a few communication operations in native PyTorch. We illustrate this approach by converging transformer based models up to 8.3 billion parameters using 512 GPUs. We sustain 15.1 PetaFLOPs across the entire application with 76% scaling efficiency when compared to a strong single GPU baseline that sustains 39 TeraFLOPs, which is 30% of peak FLOPs. To demonstrate that large language models can further advance the state of the art (SOTA), we train an 8.3 billion parameter transformer language model similar to GPT-2 and a 3.9 billion parameter model similar to BERT. We show that careful attention to the placement of layer normalization in BERT-like models is critical to achieving increased performance as the model size grows. Using the GPT-2 model we achieve SOTA results on the WikiText103 (10.8 compared to SOTA perplexity of 15.8) and LAMBADA (66.5% compared to SOTA accuracy of 63.2%) datasets. Our BERT model achieves SOTA results on the RACE dataset (90.9% compared to SOTA accuracy of 89.4%).}, note={arXiv:1909.08053 [cs]}, number={arXiv:1909.08053}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Shoeybi, Mohammad and Patwary, Mostofa and Puri, Raul and LeGresley, Patrick and Casper, Jared and Catanzaro, Bryan}, year={2020}, month=Mar }

Unfortunately, making predictions using a whole ensemble of models is cumbersome and may be too computationally expensive to allow deployment to a large number of users, especially if the individual models are large neural nets. Caruana and his collaborators have shown that it is possible to compress the knowledge in an ensemble into a single model which is much easier to deploy and we develop this approach further using a different compression technique. We achieve some surprising results on MNIST and we show that we can significantly improve the acoustic model of a heavily used commercial system by distilling the knowledge in an ensemble of models into a single model. We also introduce a new type of ensemble composed of one or more full models and many specialist models which learn to distinguish fine-grained classes that the full models confuse.

For algorithmic modeling, we give a definition of MTL and then classify different MTL algorithms into five categories, including feature learning approach, low-rank approach, task clustering approach, task relation learning approach and decomposition approach as well as discussing the characteristics of each approach. In order to improve the performance of learning tasks further, MTL can be combined with other learning paradigms including semi-supervised learning, active learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, multi-view learning and graphical models. When the number of tasks is large or the data dimensionality is high, we review online, parallel and distributed MTL models as well as dimensionality reduction and feature hashing to reveal their computational and storage advantages. Many real-world applications use MTL to boost their performance and we review representative works in this paper.

This is not scalable for many real-world scenarios where new data arrives sequentially in a stream form. We aim to address an open challenge of “Online Deep Learning” (ODL) for learning DNNs on the fly in an online setting. Unlike traditional online learning that often optimizes some convex objective function with respect to a shallow model (e.g., a linear/kernel-based hypothesis), ODL is significantly more challenging since the optimization of the DNN objective function is non-convex, and regular backpropagation does not work well in practice, especially for online learning settings. In this paper, we present a new online deep learning framework that attempts to tackle the challenges by learning DNN models of adaptive depth from a sequence of training data in an online learning setting. In particular, we propose a novel Hedge Backpropagation (HBP) method for online updating the parameters of DNN effectively, and validate the efficacy of our method on large-scale data sets, including both stationary and concept drifting scenarios.}, note={arXiv:1711.03705 [cs]}, number={arXiv:1711.03705}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Sahoo, Doyen and Pham, Quang and Lu, Jing and Hoi, Steven C.

abstract={Crick and Mitchison1 have presented a hypothesis for the functional role of dream sleep involving an `unlearning' process. We have independently carried out mathematical and computer modelling of learning and `unlearning' in a collective neural network of 30--1,000 neurones. The model network has a content-addressable memory or `associative memory' which allows it to learn and store many memories. A particular memory can be evoked in its entirety when the network is stimulated by any adequate-sized subpart of the information of that memory2. But different memories of the same size are not equally easy to recall. Also, when memories are learned, spurious memories are also created and can also be evoked. Applying an `unlearning' process, similar to the learning processes but with a reversed sign and starting from a noise input, enhances the performance of the network in accessing real memories and in minimizing spurious ones. Although our model was not motivated by higher nervous function, our system displays behaviours which are strikingly parallel to those needed for the hypothesized role of `unlearning' in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.},

We propose a simple duality between this dense associative memory and neural networks commonly used in deep learning. On the associative memory side of this duality, a family of models that smoothly interpolates between two limiting cases can be constructed. One limit is referred to as the feature-matching mode of pattern recognition, and the other one as the prototype regime. On the deep learning side of the duality, this family corresponds to feedforward neural networks with one hidden layer and various activation functions, which transmit the activities of the visible neurons to the hidden layer. This family of activation functions includes logistics, rectified linear units, and rectified polynomials of higher degrees. The proposed duality makes it possible to apply energy-based intuition from associative memory to analyze computational properties of neural networks with unusual activation functions - the higher rectified polynomials which until now have not been used in deep learning. The utility of the dense memories is illustrated for two test cases: the logical gate XOR and the recognition of handwritten digits from the MNIST data set.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 30th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems}, pages = {1180–1188}, numpages = {9}, location = {Barcelona, Spain}, series = {NIPS'16} }

 @article{Ramsauer, title={Hopfield Networks is All You Need}, url={http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02217}, abstractNote={We introduce a modern Hopfield network with continuous states and a corresponding update rule. The new Hopfield network can store exponentially (with the dimension of the associative space) many patterns, retrieves the pattern with one update, and has exponentially small retrieval errors. It has three types of energy minima (fixed points of the update): (1) global fixed point averaging over all patterns, (2) metastable states averaging over a subset of patterns, and (3) fixed points which store a single pattern. The new update rule is equivalent to the attention mechanism used in transformers. This equivalence enables a characterization of the heads of transformer models. These heads perform in the first layers preferably global averaging and in higher layers partial averaging via metastable states. The new modern Hopfield network can be integrated into deep learning architectures as layers to allow the storage of and access to raw input data, intermediate results, or learned prototypes. These Hopfield layers enable new ways of deep learning, beyond fully-connected, convolutional, or recurrent networks, and provide pooling, memory, association, and attention mechanisms. We demonstrate the broad applicability of the Hopfield layers across various domains. Hopfield layers improved state-of-the-art on three out of four considered multiple instance learning problems as well as on immune repertoire classification with several hundreds of thousands of instances. On the UCI benchmark collections of small classification tasks, where deep learning methods typically struggle, Hopfield layers yielded a new state-of-the-art when compared to different machine learning methods. Finally, Hopfield layers achieved state-of-the-art on two drug design datasets.

Recent developments in statistical modeling, along with powerful computational tools, have enabled researchers to study more sophisticated statistical models for visual images, to validate these models empirically against large sets of data, and to begin experimentally testing the efficient coding hypothesis for both individual neurons and populations of neurons.}, number={1}, journal={Annual Review of Neuroscience}, author={Simoncelli, Eero P and Olshausen, Bruno A}, year={2001}, month=Mar, pages={1193–1216}, language={en} }

We propose a new computational model for real-time computing on time-varying input that provides an alternative to paradigms based on Turing machines or attractor neural networks. It does not require a task-dependent construction of neural circuits. Instead, it is based on principles of high-dimensional dynamical systems in combination with statistical learning theory and can be implemented on generic evolved or found recurrent circuitry. It is shown that the inherent transient dynamics of the high-dimensional dynamical system formed by a sufficiently large and heterogeneous neural circuit may serve as universal analog fading memory. Readout neurons can learn to extract in real time from the current state of such recurrent neural circuit information about current and past inputs that may be needed for diverse tasks. Stable internal states are not required for giving a stable output, since transient internal states can be transformed by readout neurons into stable target outputs due to the high dimensionality of the dynamical system. Our approach is based on a rigorous computational model, the liquid state machine, that, unlike Turing machines, does not require sequential transitions between well-defined discrete internal states. It is supported, as the Turing machine is, by rigorous mathematical results that predict universal computational power under idealized conditions, but for the biologically more realistic scenario of real-time processing of time-varying inputs. Our approach provides new perspectives for the interpretation of neural coding, the design of experiments and data analysis in neurophysiology, and the solution of problems in robotics and neurotechnology.}, number={11}, journal={Neural Computation}, author={Maass, Wolfgang and Natschläger, Thomas and Markram, Henry}, year={2002}, month=Nov, pages={2531–2560}, language={en} }

We describe a systematic method to estimate its parameters with simple electrophysiological protocols (current-clamp injection of pulses and ramps) and apply it to a detailed conductance-based model of a regular spiking neuron. Our simple model predicts correctly the timing of 96% of the spikes (±2 ms) of the detailed model in response to injection of noisy synaptic conductances. The model is especially reliable in high-conductance states, typical of cortical activity in vivo, in which intrinsic conductances were found to have a reduced role in shaping spike trains. These results are promising because this simple model has enough expressive power to reproduce qualitatively several electrophysiological classes described in vitro.}, number={5}, journal={Journal of Neurophysiology}, author={Brette, Romain and Gerstner, Wulfram}, year={2005}, month=Nov, pages={3637–3642}, language={en} }

How are these strengths, by what means are ideas and imagination produced in natural neural networks? Methods: Reviewing the literature, we put forward the argument that both our natural environment and the brain are of low complexity, that is, require for their generation very little information and are consequently both highly structured. We further argue that the structures of brain and natural environment are closely related. Results: We propose that the structural regularity of the brain takes the form of net fragments (self-organized network patterns) and that these serve as the powerful inductive bias that enables the brain to learn quickly, generalize from few examples and bridge the gap between abstractly defined general goals and concrete situations. Conclusions: Our results have important bearings on open problems in artificial neural network research.}, note={arXiv:2205.00002 [cs, q-bio]}, number={arXiv:2205.00002}, publisher={arXiv}, author={von der Malsburg, Christoph and Stadelmann, Thilo and Grewe, Benjamin F.}, year={2022}, month=Apr }

Topographically ordered mappings, found widely in nervous systems, are those in which neighbouring elements in one sheet of cells project to neighbouring elements in a second sheet. Exploiting this neighbourhood property leads to a new theory for the establishment of topographical mappings, in which the distance between two cells is expressed in terms of their similarity with respect to certain physical properties assigned to them. This topographical code can be realized in a model employing either synchronization of nervous activity or exchange of specific molecules between neighbouring cells. By means of modifiable synapses the code is used to set up a topographical mapping between two sheets with the same internal structure. We have investigated the neural activity version. Without needing to make any elaborate assumptions about its structure or about the operations its elements are to carry out we have shown that the mappings are set up in a system-to-system rather than a cell-to-cell fashion. The pattern of connections develops in a step-by-step and orderly fashion, the orientation of the mappings being laid down in the earliest stages of development.}, number={1117}, journal={Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

The case of the ordered retinotectal projection in amphibia and fishes is discussed in great detail. It is suggested that retinotectal mappings are the result of two mechanisms acting in concert. One mechanism induces a set of retinal markers into the tectum. By this means, an initially haphazard pattern of synapses is transformed into a continuous or piece-wise continuous projection. The other mechanism places the individual pieces of the map in the correct orientation. The machinery necessary for this inductive scheme has been expressed in terms of a set of differential equations, which have been solved numerically for a number of cases. Straightforward assumptions are made as to how markers are distributed in the retina; how they are induced into the tectum; and how the induced markers bring about alterations in the pattern of synaptic contacts. A detailed physiological interpretation of the model is given. The inductive mechanism has been formulated at the level of the individual synaptic interactions. Therefore, it is possible to specify, in a given situation, not only the nature of the end state of the mapping but also how the mapping develops over time. The role of the modes of growth of retina and tectum in shaping the developing projection becomes clear. Since, on this model, the tectum is initially devoid of markers, there is an important difference between the development and the regeneration of ordered mappings. In the development of duplicate maps from various types of compound-eyes, it is suggested that the tectum, rather than the retina, contains an abnormal distribution of markers. An important parameter in these experiments, and also in the regeneration experiments where part-duplication has been found, is the range of interaction amongst the retinal cells. It is suggested that the results of many of the regeneration experiments (including apparently contradictory ones) are manifestations of a conflict between the two alternative ways of specifying the orientation of the map: through the information carried by the markers previously induced into the tectum and through the orientation mechanism itself.}, number={1021}, journal={Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

Neural implementation of this may be based on preorganized fiber projections that can be activated rapidly with the help of control units (Wolfrum, Wolff, Lücke, & von der Malsburg, 2008 ). Each control unit governs a set of projection fibers that form part of a coherent mapping. We describe a mathematical model for the ontogenesis of the underlying connectivity based on a principle of network self-organization as described by the Häussler system (Häussler & von der Malsburg, 1983 ), modified to be sensitive to pattern similarity and to support formation of multiple mappings, each under the command of a control unit. The process takes the form of a soft-winner-take-all, where units compete for the representation of maps.

They are useful for faithful parallel processing of lattice models. At another level, they exhibit behaviours and illustrate concepts that are unmistakably physical, such as non-ergodicity and order parameters, frustration, relaxation to chaos through period doublings, a conspicuous arrow of time in reversible microscopic dynamics, causality and light-cone, and non-separability. In general, they constitute exactly computable models for complex phenomena and large-scale correlations that result from very simple short-range interactions. We study their space, time, and intrinsic symmetries and the corresponding conservation laws, with an emphasis on the conservation of information obeyed by reversible cellular automata.}

 @article{Mordvintsev_Randazzo_Fouts_2022, title={Growing Isotropic Neural Cellular Automata}, url={http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01681}, abstractNote={Modeling the ability of multicellular organisms to build and maintain their bodies through local interactions between individual cells (morphogenesis) is a long-standing challenge of developmental biology. Recently, the Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) model was proposed as a way to find local system rules that produce a desired global behaviour, such as growing and persisting a predefined target pattern, by repeatedly applying the same rule over a grid starting from a single cell. In this work, we argue that the original Growing NCA model has an important limitation: anisotropy of the learned update rule. This implies the presence of an external factor that orients the cells in a particular direction. In other words, “physical” rules of the underlying system are not invariant to rotation, thus prohibiting the existence of differently oriented instances of the target pattern on the same grid. We propose a modified Isotropic NCA (IsoNCA) model that does not have this limitation. We demonstrate that such cell systems can be trained to grow accurate asymmetrical patterns through either of two methods: (1) by breaking symmetries using structured seeds or (2) by introducing a rotation-reflection invariant training objective and relying on symmetry-breaking caused by asynchronous cell updates.}, note={arXiv:2205.01681 [cs, q-bio]}, number={arXiv:2205.01681}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Mordvintsev, Alexander and Randazzo, Ettore and Fouts, Craig}, year={2022}, month=Jun }

Inspired by the incredible diversity of this biological generative process, we propose a generative model, the Variational Neural Cellular Automata (VNCA), which is loosely inspired by the biological processes of cellular growth and differentiation. Unlike previous related works, the VNCA is a proper probabilistic generative model, and we evaluate it according to best practices. We find that the VNCA learns to reconstruct samples well and that despite its relatively few parameters and simple local-only communication, the VNCA can learn to generate a large variety of output from information encoded in a common vector format. While there is a significant gap to the current state-of-the-art in terms of generative modeling performance, we show that the VNCA can learn a purely self-organizing generative process of data. Additionally, we show that the VNCA can learn a distribution of stable attractors that can recover from significant damage.}, note={arXiv:2201.12360 [cs]}, number={arXiv:2201.12360}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Palm, Rasmus Berg and González-Duque, Miguel and Sudhakaran, Shyam and Risi, Sebastian}, year={2022}, month=Feb }

First, we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods.

Minecraft is selected as the environment for our automaton since it allows the generation of both static structures and moving machines. We show that despite their simplicity, NCAs are capable of growing complex entities such as castles, apartment blocks, and trees, some of which are composed of over 3,000 blocks.

Lack of this regenerative capacity significantly limits the resilience of machines and the environments they can operate in. To aid in addressing this gap, we develop an approach for simulated soft robots to regrow parts of their morphology when being damaged. Although numerical simulations using soft robots have played an important role in their design, evolving soft robots with regenerative capabilities have so far received comparable little attention. Here we propose a model for soft robots that regenerate through a neural cellular automata. Importantly, this approach only relies on local cell information to regrow damaged components, opening interesting possibilities for physical regenerable soft robots in the future. Our approach allows simulated soft robots that are damaged to partially regenerate their original morphology through local cell interactions alone and regain some of their ability to locomote. These results take a step towards equipping artificial systems with regenerative capacities and could potentially allow for more robust operations in a variety of situations and environments.

In particular, we extend previous work that used convolutional neural networks to learn the transition rule of conventional CA and we use graph neural networks to learn a variety of transition rules for GCA. First, we present a general-purpose architecture for learning GCA, and we show that it can represent any arbitrary GCA with finite and discrete state space. Then, we test our approach on three different tasks: 1) learning the transition rule of a GCA on a Voronoi tessellation; 2) imitating the behaviour of a group of flocking agents; 3) learning a rule that converges to a desired target state.}, note={arXiv:2110.14237 [cs]}, number={arXiv:2110.14237}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Grattarola, Daniele and Livi, Lorenzo and Alippi, Cesare}, year={2021}, month=Oct }

To improve the robustness displayed by plastic Hebbian neural networks, we evolve a set of Hebbian learning rules, where multiple connections are assigned to a single rule. Inspired by the biological phenomenon of the genomic bottleneck, we show that by allowing multiple connections in the network to share the same local learning rule, it is possible to drastically reduce the number of trainable parameters, while obtaining a more robust agent. During evolution, by iteratively using simple K-Means clustering to combine rules, our Evolve and Merge approach is able to reduce the number of trainable parameters from 61,440 to 1,920, while at the same time improving robustness, all without increasing the number of generations used. While optimization of the agents is done on a standard quadruped robot morphology, we evaluate the agents’ performances on slight morphology modifications in a total of 30 unseen morphologies. Our results add to the discussion on generalization, overfitting and OOD adaptation. To create agents that can adapt to a wider array of unexpected situations, Hebbian learning combined with a regularising “genomic bottleneck” could be a promising research direction.}, note={arXiv:2104.07959 [cs]}, booktitle={Proceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference}, author={Pedersen, Joachim Winther and Risi, Sebastian}, year={2021}, month=Jun, pages={892–900} }

A key mechanism that enables the formation of complex architecture in the developing brain is the emergence of traveling spatio-temporal waves of neuronal activity across the growing brain. Inspired by this strategy, we attempt to efficiently self-organize large neural networks with an arbitrary number of layers into a wide variety of architectures. To achieve this, we propose a modular tool-kit in the form of a dynamical system that can be seamlessly stacked to assemble multi-layer neural networks. The dynamical system encapsulates the dynamics of spiking units, their inter/intra layer interactions as well as the plasticity rules that control the flow of information between layers. The key features of our tool-kit are (1) autonomous spatio-temporal waves across multiple layers triggered by activity in the preceding layer and (2) Spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) learning rules that update the inter-layer connectivity based on wave activity in the connecting layers. Our framework leads to the self-organization of a wide variety of architectures, ranging from multi-layer perceptrons to autoencoders. We also demonstrate that emergent waves can self-organize spiking network architecture to perform unsupervised learning, and networks can be coupled with a linear classifier to perform classification on classic image datasets like MNIST. Broadly, our work shows that a dynamical systems framework for learning can be used to self-organize large computational devices.}, note={arXiv:2006.06902 [cs, q-bio]}, number={arXiv:2006.06902}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Raghavan, Guruprasad and Lin, Cong and Thomson, Matt}, year={2020}, month=Jun }

In this paper, we propose a novel interpretation of neural style transfer by treating it as a domain adaptation problem. Specifically, we theoretically show that matching the Gram matrices of feature maps is equivalent to minimize the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) with the second order polynomial kernel. Thus, we argue that the essence of neural style transfer is to match the feature distributions between the style images and the generated images. To further support our standpoint, we experiment with several other distribution alignment methods, and achieve appealing results.

The main objective is to provide an understanding of the properties of information representations from a general point of view and of their use in pattern information processing, as well as an understanding of many functions of the brain. In the third edition two new discussions have been added and a proof has been revised.
