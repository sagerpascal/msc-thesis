 @article{Shoeybi_Patwary_Puri_LeGresley_Casper_Catanzaro_2020, title={Megatron-LM: Training Multi-Billion Parameter Language Models Using Model Parallelism}, url={http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.08053}, abstractNote={Recent work in language modeling demonstrates that training large transformer models advances the state of the art in Natural Language Processing applications. However, very large models can be quite difficult to train due to memory constraints. In this work, we present our techniques for training very large transformer models and implement a simple, efficient intra-layer model parallel approach that enables training transformer models with billions of parameters. Our approach does not require a new compiler or library changes, is orthogonal and complimentary to pipeline model parallelism, and can be fully implemented with the insertion of a few communication operations in native PyTorch. We illustrate this approach by converging transformer based models up to 8.3 billion parameters using 512 GPUs. We sustain 15.1 PetaFLOPs across the entire application with 76% scaling efficiency when compared to a strong single GPU baseline that sustains 39 TeraFLOPs, which is 30% of peak FLOPs. To demonstrate that large language models can further advance the state of the art (SOTA), we train an 8.3 billion parameter transformer language model similar to GPT-2 and a 3.9 billion parameter model similar to BERT. We show that careful attention to the placement of layer normalization in BERT-like models is critical to achieving increased performance as the model size grows. Using the GPT-2 model we achieve SOTA results on the WikiText103 (10.8 compared to SOTA perplexity of 15.8) and LAMBADA (66.5% compared to SOTA accuracy of 63.2%) datasets. Our BERT model achieves SOTA results on the RACE dataset (90.9% compared to SOTA accuracy of 89.4%).}, note={arXiv:1909.08053 [cs]}, number={arXiv:1909.08053}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Shoeybi, Mohammad and Patwary, Mostofa and Puri, Raul and LeGresley, Patrick and Casper, Jared and Catanzaro, Bryan}, year={2020}, month={Mar} }

In this paper we review the mathematical aspects of quantization parameters and evaluate their choices on a wide range of neural network models for different application domains, including vision, speech, and language. We focus on quantization techniques that are amenable to acceleration by processors with high-throughput integer math pipelines. We also present a workflow for 8-bit quantization that is able to maintain accuracy within 1% of the floating-point baseline on all networks studied, including models that are more difficult to quantize, such as MobileNets and BERT-large.}, note={arXiv:2004.09602 [cs, stat]}, number={arXiv:2004.09602}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Wu, Hao and Judd, Patrick and Zhang, Xiaojie and Isaev, Mikhail and Micikevicius, Paulius}, year={2020}, month={Apr} }

  @article{Hinton_Vinyals_Dean_2015, title={Distilling the Knowledge in a Neural Network}, url={http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02531}, abstractNote={A very simple way to improve the performance of almost any machine learning algorithm is to train many different models on the same data and then to average their predictions. Unfortunately, making predictions using a whole ensemble of models is cumbersome and may be too computationally expensive to allow deployment to a large number of users, especially if the individual models are large neural nets. Caruana and his collaborators have shown that it is possible to compress the knowledge in an ensemble into a single model which is much easier to deploy and we develop this approach further using a different compression technique. We achieve some surprising results on MNIST and we show that we can significantly improve the acoustic model of a heavily used commercial system by distilling the knowledge in an ensemble of models into a single model. We also introduce a new type of ensemble composed of one or more full models and many specialist models which learn to distinguish fine-grained classes that the full models confuse. Unlike a mixture of experts, these specialist models can be trained rapidly and in parallel.}, note={arXiv:1503.02531 [cs, stat]}, number={arXiv:1503.02531}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Hinton, Geoffrey and Vinyals, Oriol and Dean, Jeff}, year={2015}, month={Mar} }

  @article{Zhang_Yang_2021, title={A Survey on Multi-Task Learning}, url={http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.08114}, abstractNote={Multi-Task Learning (MTL) is a learning paradigm in machine learning and its aim is to leverage useful information contained in multiple related tasks to help improve the generalization performance of all the tasks. In this paper, we give a survey for MTL from the perspective of algorithmic modeling, applications and theoretical analyses. For algorithmic modeling, we give a definition of MTL and then classify different MTL algorithms into five categories, including feature learning approach, low-rank approach, task clustering approach, task relation learning approach and decomposition approach as well as discussing the characteristics of each approach. In order to improve the performance of learning tasks further, MTL can be combined with other learning paradigms including semi-supervised learning, active learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, multi-view learning and graphical models. When the number of tasks is large or the data dimensionality is high, we review online, parallel and distributed MTL models as well as dimensionality reduction and feature hashing to reveal their computational and storage advantages. Many real-world applications use MTL to boost their performance and we review representative works in this paper. Finally, we present theoretical analyses and discuss several future directions for MTL.}, note={arXiv:1707.08114 [cs]}, number={arXiv:1707.08114}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Zhang, Yu and Yang, Qiang}, year={2021}, month={Mar} }

 @article{Sahoo_Pham_Lu_Hoi_2017, title={Online Deep Learning: Learning Deep Neural Networks on the Fly}, url={http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03705}, abstractNote={Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are typically trained by backpropagation in a batch learning setting, which requires the entire training data to be made available prior to the learning task. This is not scalable for many real-world scenarios where new data arrives sequentially in a stream form. We aim to address an open challenge of “Online Deep Learning” (ODL) for learning DNNs on the fly in an online setting. Unlike traditional online learning that often optimizes some convex objective function with respect to a shallow model (e.g., a linear/kernel-based hypothesis), ODL is significantly more challenging since the optimization of the DNN objective function is non-convex, and regular backpropagation does not work well in practice, especially for online learning settings. In this paper, we present a new online deep learning framework that attempts to tackle the challenges by learning DNN models of adaptive depth from a sequence of training data in an online learning setting. In particular, we propose a novel Hedge Backpropagation (HBP) method for online updating the parameters of DNN effectively, and validate the efficacy of our method on large-scale data sets, including both stationary and concept drifting scenarios.}, note={arXiv:1711.03705 [cs]}, number={arXiv:1711.03705}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Sahoo, Doyen and Pham, Quang and Lu, Jing and Hoi, Steven C.
