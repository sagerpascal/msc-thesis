However, very large models can be quite difficult to train due to memory constraints. In this work, we present our techniques for training very large transformer models and implement a simple, efficient intra-layer model parallel approach that enables training transformer models with billions of parameters. Our approach does not require a new compiler or library changes, is orthogonal and complimentary to pipeline model parallelism, and can be fully implemented with the insertion of a few communication operations in native PyTorch. We illustrate this approach by converging transformer based models up to 8.3 billion parameters using 512 GPUs. We sustain 15.1 PetaFLOPs across the entire application with 76% scaling efficiency when compared to a strong single GPU baseline that sustains 39 TeraFLOPs, which is 30% of peak FLOPs. To demonstrate that large language models can further advance the state of the art (SOTA), we train an 8.3 billion parameter transformer language model similar to GPT-2 and a 3.9 billion parameter model similar to BERT. We show that careful attention to the placement of layer normalization in BERT-like models is critical to achieving increased performance as the model size grows. Using the GPT-2 model we achieve SOTA results on the WikiText103 (10.8 compared to SOTA perplexity of 15.8) and LAMBADA (66.5% compared to SOTA accuracy of 63.2%) datasets. Our BERT model achieves SOTA results on the RACE dataset (90.9% compared to SOTA accuracy of 89.4%).}, note={arXiv:1909.08053 [cs]}, number={arXiv:1909.08053}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Shoeybi, Mohammad and Patwary, Mostofa and Puri, Raul and LeGresley, Patrick and Casper, Jared and Catanzaro, Bryan}, year={2020}, month=Mar }

Unfortunately, making predictions using a whole ensemble of models is cumbersome and may be too computationally expensive to allow deployment to a large number of users, especially if the individual models are large neural nets. Caruana and his collaborators have shown that it is possible to compress the knowledge in an ensemble into a single model which is much easier to deploy and we develop this approach further using a different compression technique. We achieve some surprising results on MNIST and we show that we can significantly improve the acoustic model of a heavily used commercial system by distilling the knowledge in an ensemble of models into a single model. We also introduce a new type of ensemble composed of one or more full models and many specialist models which learn to distinguish fine-grained classes that the full models confuse.

For algorithmic modeling, we give a definition of MTL and then classify different MTL algorithms into five categories, including feature learning approach, low-rank approach, task clustering approach, task relation learning approach and decomposition approach as well as discussing the characteristics of each approach. In order to improve the performance of learning tasks further, MTL can be combined with other learning paradigms including semi-supervised learning, active learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, multi-view learning and graphical models. When the number of tasks is large or the data dimensionality is high, we review online, parallel and distributed MTL models as well as dimensionality reduction and feature hashing to reveal their computational and storage advantages. Many real-world applications use MTL to boost their performance and we review representative works in this paper. Finally, we present theoretical analyses and discuss several future directions for MTL.}, note={arXiv:1707.08114 [cs]}, number={arXiv:1707.08114}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Zhang, Yu and Yang, Qiang}, year={2021}, month=Mar }

This is not scalable for many real-world scenarios where new data arrives sequentially in a stream form. We aim to address an open challenge of “Online Deep Learning” (ODL) for learning DNNs on the fly in an online setting. Unlike traditional online learning that often optimizes some convex objective function with respect to a shallow model (e.g., a linear/kernel-based hypothesis), ODL is significantly more challenging since the optimization of the DNN objective function is non-convex, and regular backpropagation does not work well in practice, especially for online learning settings. In this paper, we present a new online deep learning framework that attempts to tackle the challenges by learning DNN models of adaptive depth from a sequence of training data in an online learning setting. In particular, we propose a novel Hedge Backpropagation (HBP) method for online updating the parameters of DNN effectively, and validate the efficacy of our method on large-scale data sets, including both stationary and concept drifting scenarios.}, note={arXiv:1711.03705 [cs]}, number={arXiv:1711.03705}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Sahoo, Doyen and Pham, Quang and Lu, Jing and Hoi, Steven C.

abstract={Crick and Mitchison1 have presented a hypothesis for the functional role of dream sleep involving an `unlearning' process. We have independently carried out mathematical and computer modelling of learning and `unlearning' in a collective neural network of 30--1,000 neurones. The model network has a content-addressable memory or `associative memory' which allows it to learn and store many memories. A particular memory can be evoked in its entirety when the network is stimulated by any adequate-sized subpart of the information of that memory2. But different memories of the same size are not equally easy to recall. Also, when memories are learned, spurious memories are also created and can also be evoked. Applying an `unlearning' process, similar to the learning processes but with a reversed sign and starting from a noise input, enhances the performance of the network in accessing real memories and in minimizing spurious ones. Although our model was not motivated by higher nervous function, our system displays behaviours which are strikingly parallel to those needed for the hypothesized role of `unlearning' in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.},

We propose a simple duality between this dense associative memory and neural networks commonly used in deep learning. On the associative memory side of this duality, a family of models that smoothly interpolates between two limiting cases can be constructed. One limit is referred to as the feature-matching mode of pattern recognition, and the other one as the prototype regime. On the deep learning side of the duality, this family corresponds to feedforward neural networks with one hidden layer and various activation functions, which transmit the activities of the visible neurons to the hidden layer. This family of activation functions includes logistics, rectified linear units, and rectified polynomials of higher degrees. The proposed duality makes it possible to apply energy-based intuition from associative memory to analyze computational properties of neural networks with unusual activation functions - the higher rectified polynomials which until now have not been used in deep learning. The utility of the dense memories is illustrated for two test cases: the logical gate XOR and the recognition of handwritten digits from the MNIST data set.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 30th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems}, pages = {1180–1188}, numpages = {9}, location = {Barcelona, Spain}, series = {NIPS'16} }

 @article{Ramsauer, title={Hopfield Networks is All You Need}, url={http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02217}, abstractNote={We introduce a modern Hopfield network with continuous states and a corresponding update rule. The new Hopfield network can store exponentially (with the dimension of the associative space) many patterns, retrieves the pattern with one update, and has exponentially small retrieval errors. It has three types of energy minima (fixed points of the update): (1) global fixed point averaging over all patterns, (2) metastable states averaging over a subset of patterns, and (3) fixed points which store a single pattern. The new update rule is equivalent to the attention mechanism used in transformers. This equivalence enables a characterization of the heads of transformer models. These heads perform in the first layers preferably global averaging and in higher layers partial averaging via metastable states. The new modern Hopfield network can be integrated into deep learning architectures as layers to allow the storage of and access to raw input data, intermediate results, or learned prototypes. These Hopfield layers enable new ways of deep learning, beyond fully-connected, convolutional, or recurrent networks, and provide pooling, memory, association, and attention mechanisms. We demonstrate the broad applicability of the Hopfield layers across various domains. Hopfield layers improved state-of-the-art on three out of four considered multiple instance learning problems as well as on immune repertoire classification with several hundreds of thousands of instances. On the UCI benchmark collections of small classification tasks, where deep learning methods typically struggle, Hopfield layers yielded a new state-of-the-art when compared to different machine learning methods. Finally, Hopfield layers achieved state-of-the-art on two drug design datasets.

We propose a new computational model for real-time computing on time-varying input that provides an alternative to paradigms based on Turing machines or attractor neural networks. It does not require a task-dependent construction of neural circuits. Instead, it is based on principles of high-dimensional dynamical systems in combination with statistical learning theory and can be implemented on generic evolved or found recurrent circuitry. It is shown that the inherent transient dynamics of the high-dimensional dynamical system formed by a sufficiently large and heterogeneous neural circuit may serve as universal analog fading memory. Readout neurons can learn to extract in real time from the current state of such recurrent neural circuit information about current and past inputs that may be needed for diverse tasks. Stable internal states are not required for giving a stable output, since transient internal states can be transformed by readout neurons into stable target outputs due to the high dimensionality of the dynamical system. Our approach is based on a rigorous computational model, the liquid state machine, that, unlike Turing machines, does not require sequential transitions between well-defined discrete internal states. It is supported, as the Turing machine is, by rigorous mathematical results that predict universal computational power under idealized conditions, but for the biologically more realistic scenario of real-time processing of time-varying inputs. Our approach provides new perspectives for the interpretation of neural coding, the design of experiments and data analysis in neurophysiology, and the solution of problems in robotics and neurotechnology.}, number={11}, journal={Neural Computation}, author={Maass, Wolfgang and Natschläger, Thomas and Markram, Henry}, year={2002}, month=Nov, pages={2531–2560}, language={en} }

We describe a systematic method to estimate its parameters with simple electrophysiological protocols (current-clamp injection of pulses and ramps) and apply it to a detailed conductance-based model of a regular spiking neuron. Our simple model predicts correctly the timing of 96% of the spikes (±2 ms) of the detailed model in response to injection of noisy synaptic conductances. The model is especially reliable in high-conductance states, typical of cortical activity in vivo, in which intrinsic conductances were found to have a reduced role in shaping spike trains.

How are these strengths, by what means are ideas and imagination produced in natural neural networks? Methods: Reviewing the literature, we put forward the argument that both our natural environment and the brain are of low complexity, that is, require for their generation very little information and are consequently both highly structured. We further argue that the structures of brain and natural environment are closely related. Results: We propose that the structural regularity of the brain takes the form of net fragments (self-organized network patterns) and that these serve as the powerful inductive bias that enables the brain to learn quickly, generalize from few examples and bridge the gap between abstractly defined general goals and concrete situations. Conclusions: Our results have important bearings on open problems in artificial neural network research.}, note={arXiv:2205.00002 [cs, q-bio]}, number={arXiv:2205.00002}, publisher={arXiv}, author={{von der Malsburg}, Christoph and Stadelmann, Thilo and Grewe, Benjamin F.}, year={2022}, month=Apr }

Topographically ordered mappings, found widely in nervous systems, are those in which neighbouring elements in one sheet of cells project to neighbouring elements in a second sheet. Exploiting this neighbourhood property leads to a new theory for the establishment of topographical mappings, in which the distance between two cells is expressed in terms of their similarity with respect to certain physical properties assigned to them. This topographical code can be realized in a model employing either synchronization of nervous activity or exchange of specific molecules between neighbouring cells. By means of modifiable synapses the code is used to set up a topographical mapping between two sheets with the same internal structure. We have investigated the neural activity version. Without needing to make any elaborate assumptions about its structure or about the operations its elements are to carry out we have shown that the mappings are set up in a system-to-system rather than a cell-to-cell fashion. The pattern of connections develops in a step-by-step and orderly fashion, the orientation of the mappings being laid down in the earliest stages of development.}, number={1117}, journal={Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

The case of the ordered retinotectal projection in amphibia and fishes is discussed in great detail. It is suggested that retinotectal mappings are the result of two mechanisms acting in concert. One mechanism induces a set of retinal markers into the tectum. By this means, an initially haphazard pattern of synapses is transformed into a continuous or piece-wise continuous projection. The other mechanism places the individual pieces of the map in the correct orientation. The machinery necessary for this inductive scheme has been expressed in terms of a set of differential equations, which have been solved numerically for a number of cases. Straightforward assumptions are made as to how markers are distributed in the retina; how they are induced into the tectum; and how the induced markers bring about alterations in the pattern of synaptic contacts. A detailed physiological interpretation of the model is given. The inductive mechanism has been formulated at the level of the individual synaptic interactions. Therefore, it is possible to specify, in a given situation, not only the nature of the end state of the mapping but also how the mapping develops over time. The role of the modes of growth of retina and tectum in shaping the developing projection becomes clear. Since, on this model, the tectum is initially devoid of markers, there is an important difference between the development and the regeneration of ordered mappings. In the development of duplicate maps from various types of compound-eyes, it is suggested that the tectum, rather than the retina, contains an abnormal distribution of markers. An important parameter in these experiments, and also in the regeneration experiments where part-duplication has been found, is the range of interaction amongst the retinal cells. It is suggested that the results of many of the regeneration experiments (including apparently contradictory ones) are manifestations of a conflict between the two alternative ways of specifying the orientation of the map: through the information carried by the markers previously induced into the tectum and through the orientation mechanism itself.}, number={1021}, journal={Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

Neural implementation of this may be based on preorganized fiber projections that can be activated rapidly with the help of control units (Wolfrum, Wolff, Lücke, & von der Malsburg, 2008 ). Each control unit governs a set of projection fibers that form part of a coherent mapping. We describe a mathematical model for the ontogenesis of the underlying connectivity based on a principle of network self-organization as described by the Häussler system (Häussler & von der Malsburg, 1983 ), modified to be sensitive to pattern similarity and to support formation of multiple mappings, each under the command of a control unit. The process takes the form of a soft-winner-take-all, where units compete for the representation of maps.

abstract = {Cellular automata are dynamical systems where space, time, and variables are discrete. They are shown on two-dimensional examples to be capable of non-numerical simulations of physics. They are useful for faithful parallel processing of lattice models. At another level, they exhibit behaviours and illustrate concepts that are unmistakably physical, such as non-ergodicity and order parameters, frustration, relaxation to chaos through period doublings, a conspicuous arrow of time in reversible microscopic dynamics, causality and light-cone, and non-separability. In general, they constitute exactly computable models for complex phenomena and large-scale correlations that result from very simple short-range interactions. We study their space, time, and intrinsic symmetries and the corresponding conservation laws, with an emphasis on the conservation of information obeyed by reversible cellular automata.}

Recently, the Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) model was proposed as a way to find local system rules that produce a desired global behaviour, such as growing and persisting a predefined target pattern, by repeatedly applying the same rule over a grid starting from a single cell. In this work, we argue that the original Growing NCA model has an important limitation: anisotropy of the learned update rule. This implies the presence of an external factor that orients the cells in a particular direction. In other words, “physical” rules of the underlying system are not invariant to rotation, thus prohibiting the existence of differently oriented instances of the target pattern on the same grid. We propose a modified Isotropic NCA (IsoNCA) model that does not have this limitation. We demonstrate that such cell systems can be trained to grow accurate asymmetrical patterns through either of two methods: (1) by breaking symmetries using structured seeds or (2) by introducing a rotation-reflection invariant training objective and relying on symmetry-breaking caused by asynchronous cell updates.}, note={arXiv:2205.01681 [cs, q-bio]}, number={arXiv:2205.01681}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Mordvintsev, Alexander and Randazzo, Ettore and Fouts, Craig}, year={2022}, month=Jun }

Inspired by the incredible diversity of this biological generative process, we propose a generative model, the Variational Neural Cellular Automata (VNCA), which is loosely inspired by the biological processes of cellular growth and differentiation. Unlike previous related works, the VNCA is a proper probabilistic generative model, and we evaluate it according to best practices. We find that the VNCA learns to reconstruct samples well and that despite its relatively few parameters and simple local-only communication, the VNCA can learn to generate a large variety of output from information encoded in a common vector format. While there is a significant gap to the current state-of-the-art in terms of generative modeling performance, we show that the VNCA can learn a purely self-organizing generative process of data. Additionally, we show that the VNCA can learn a distribution of stable attractors that can recover from significant damage.}, note={arXiv:2201.12360 [cs]}, number={arXiv:2201.12360}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Palm, Rasmus Berg and González-Duque, Miguel and Sudhakaran, Shyam and Risi, Sebastian}, year={2022}, month=Feb }

Lack of this regenerative capacity significantly limits the resilience of machines and the environments they can operate in. To aid in addressing this gap, we develop an approach for simulated soft robots to regrow parts of their morphology when being damaged. Although numerical simulations using soft robots have played an important role in their design, evolving soft robots with regenerative capabilities have so far received comparable little attention. Here we propose a model for soft robots that regenerate through a neural cellular automata. Importantly, this approach only relies on local cell information to regrow damaged components, opening interesting possibilities for physical regenerable soft robots in the future. Our approach allows simulated soft robots that are damaged to partially regenerate their original morphology through local cell interactions alone and regain some of their ability to locomote. These results take a step towards equipping artificial systems with regenerative capacities and could potentially allow for more robust operations in a variety of situations and environments.

In particular, we extend previous work that used convolutional neural networks to learn the transition rule of conventional CA and we use graph neural networks to learn a variety of transition rules for GCA. First, we present a general-purpose architecture for learning GCA, and we show that it can represent any arbitrary GCA with finite and discrete state space.

To improve the robustness displayed by plastic Hebbian neural networks, we evolve a set of Hebbian learning rules, where multiple connections are assigned to a single rule. Inspired by the biological phenomenon of the genomic bottleneck, we show that by allowing multiple connections in the network to share the same local learning rule, it is possible to drastically reduce the number of trainable parameters, while obtaining a more robust agent. During evolution, by iteratively using simple K-Means clustering to combine rules, our Evolve and Merge approach is able to reduce the number of trainable parameters from 61,440 to 1,920, while at the same time improving robustness, all without increasing the number of generations used. While optimization of the agents is done on a standard quadruped robot morphology, we evaluate the agents’ performances on slight morphology modifications in a total of 30 unseen morphologies. Our results add to the discussion on generalization, overfitting and OOD adaptation. To create agents that can adapt to a wider array of unexpected situations, Hebbian learning combined with a regularising “genomic bottleneck” could be a promising research direction.}, note={arXiv:2104.07959 [cs]}, booktitle={Proceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference}, author={Pedersen, Joachim Winther and Risi, Sebastian}, year={2021}, month=Jun, pages={892–900} }

A key mechanism that enables the formation of complex architecture in the developing brain is the emergence of traveling spatio-temporal waves of neuronal activity across the growing brain. Inspired by this strategy, we attempt to efficiently self-organize large neural networks with an arbitrary number of layers into a wide variety of architectures. To achieve this, we propose a modular tool-kit in the form of a dynamical system that can be seamlessly stacked to assemble multi-layer neural networks. The dynamical system encapsulates the dynamics of spiking units, their inter/intra layer interactions as well as the plasticity rules that control the flow of information between layers. The key features of our tool-kit are (1) autonomous spatio-temporal waves across multiple layers triggered by activity in the preceding layer and (2) Spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) learning rules that update the inter-layer connectivity based on wave activity in the connecting layers. Our framework leads to the self-organization of a wide variety of architectures, ranging from multi-layer perceptrons to autoencoders. We also demonstrate that emergent waves can self-organize spiking network architecture to perform unsupervised learning, and networks can be coupled with a linear classifier to perform classification on classic image datasets like MNIST. Broadly, our work shows that a dynamical systems framework for learning can be used to self-organize large computational devices.}, note={arXiv:2006.06902 [cs, q-bio]}, number={arXiv:2006.06902}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Raghavan, Guruprasad and Lin, Cong and Thomson, Matt}, year={2020}, month=Jun }

In this paper, we propose a novel interpretation of neural style transfer by treating it as a domain adaptation problem. Specifically, we theoretically show that matching the Gram matrices of feature maps is equivalent to minimize the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) with the second order polynomial kernel. Thus, we argue that the essence of neural style transfer is to match the feature distributions between the style images and the generated images. To further support our standpoint, we experiment with several other distribution alignment methods, and achieve appealing results.

 @book{Kohonen_1989, address={Berlin, Heidelberg}, edition={Third edition}, title={Self-Organization and Associative Memory}, ISBN={978-3-642-88163-3}, abstractNote={This monograph gives a tutorial treatment of new approaches to self-organization, adaptation, learning and memory. It is based on recent research results, both mathematical and computer simulations, and lends itself to graduate and postgraduate courses in the natural sciences. The book presents new formalisms of pattern processing: orthogonal projectors, optimal associative mappings, novelty filters, subspace methods, feature-sensitive units, and self-organization of topological maps, with all their computable algorithms. The main objective is to provide an understanding of the properties of information representations from a general point of view and of their use in pattern information processing, as well as an understanding of many functions of the brain. In the third edition two new discussions have been added and a proof has been revised.

Can we acquire such models by interacting with the world, and can we state mathematical desiderata for their relationship with a hypothetical reality existing outside our heads? As machine learning is moving towards representations containing not just observational but also interventional knowledge, we study these problems using tools from representation learning and group theory. Under the assumption that our actuators act upon the world, we propose methods to learn internal representations of not just sensory information but also of actions that modify our sensory representations in a way that is consistent with the actions and transitions in the world. We use an autoencoder equipped with a group representation linearly acting on its latent space, trained on 2-step reconstruction such as to enforce a suitable homomorphism property on the group representation. Compared to existing work, our approach makes fewer assumptions on the group representation and on which transformations the agent can sample from the group. We motivate our method theoretically, and demonstrate empirically that it can learn the correct representation of the groups and the topology of the environment. We also compare its performance in trajectory prediction with previous methods.}, note={arXiv:2207.12067 [cs, math, stat]}, number={arXiv:2207.12067}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Keurti, Hamza and Pan, Hsiao-Ru and Besserve, Michel and Grewe, Benjamin F. and Schölkopf, Bernhard}, year={2022}, month=Jul }

A limitation of such systems is that either the correct slices must be extracted manually or labels of the vertebrae are required for each CT scan to develop an automated extraction system. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) approach for vertebrae detection and identification based on a novel Domain Sanity Loss (DSL) function. With UDA the model’s knowledge learned on a publicly available (source) data set can be transferred to the target domain without using target labels, where the target domain is defined by the specific setup (CT modality, study protocols, applied pre- and processing) at the point of use (e.g., a specific clinic with its specific CT study protocols). With our approach, a model is trained on the source and target data set in parallel. The model optimizes a supervised loss for labeled samples from the source domain and the DSL loss function based on domain-specific “sanity checks” for samples from the unlabeled target domain. Without using labels from the target domain, we are able to identify vertebra centroids with an accuracy of 72.8%. By adding only ten target labels during training the accuracy increases to 89.2%, which is on par with the current state-of-the-art for full supervised learning, while using about 20 times less labels. Thus, our model can be used to extract 2D slices from 3D CT scans on arbitrary data sets fully automatically without requiring an extensive labeling effort, contributing to the clinical adoption of medical imaging by hospitals.}, number={8}, journal={Journal of Imaging}, author={Sager, Pascal and Salzmann, Sebastian and Burn, Felice and Stadelmann, Thilo}, year={2022}, month=Aug, pages={222}, language={en} }

Convolutional neural networks are sometimes trained using data augmentation to exploit this, but they are still required to learn the rotation equivariance properties from the data. Encoding these properties into the network architecture, as we are already used to doing for translation equivariance by using convolutional layers, could result in a more efficient use of the parameter budget by relieving the model from learning them. We introduce four operations which can be inserted into neural network models as layers, and which can be combined to make these models partially equivariant to rotations. They also enable parameter sharing across different orientations. We evaluate the effect of these architectural modifications on three datasets which exhibit rotational symmetry and demonstrate improved performance with smaller models.}, note={arXiv:1602.02660 [cs]}, number={arXiv:1602.02660}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Dieleman, Sander and De Fauw, Jeffrey and Kavukcuoglu, Koray}, year={2016}, month=May }

This operator is able to efficiently handle prior knowledge on nuisance variations in the data, such as rotation or scale changes. Most current methods usually make use of dataset augmentation to address this issue, but this requires larger number of model parameters and more training data, and results in significantly increased training time and larger chance of under- or overfitting. The main reason for these drawbacks is that the learned model needs to capture adequate features for all the possible transformations of the input. On the other hand, we formulate features in convolutional neural networks to be transformation-invariant. We achieve that using parallel siamese architectures for the considered transformation set and applying the TI-POOLING operator on their outputs before the fully-connected layers. We show that this topology internally finds the most optimal “canonical” instance of the input image for training and therefore limits the redundancy in learned features. This more efficient use of training data results in better performance on popular benchmark datasets with smaller number of parameters when comparing to standard convolutional neural networks with dataset augmentation and to other baselines.}, note={arXiv:1604.06318 [cs]}, number={arXiv:1604.06318}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Laptev, Dmitry and Savinov, Nikolay and Buhmann, Joachim M. and Pollefeys, Marc}, year={2016}, month=Sep }

The widely used standard Dropout has advantage of preventing deep neural networks from overfitting by randomly dropping units during training. Our sDropout randomly splits the data into two subsets and keeps both rather than discards one subset. We also introduce two rotational convolution techniques, i.e. rotate-pooling convolution (RPC) and flip-rotate-pooling convolution (FRPC) to boost CNNs’ performance on the robustness for rotation transformation. These two techniques encode rotation invariance into the network without adding extra parameters. Experimental evaluations on ImageNet2012 classification task demonstrate that sDropout not only enhances the performance but also converges faster. Additionally, RPC and FRPC make CNNs more robust for rotation transformations. Overall, FRPC together with sDropout bring $1.18%$ (model of Zeiler and Fergus~cite{zeiler2013visualizing}, 10-view, top-1) accuracy increase in ImageNet 2012 classification task compared to the original network.}, note={arXiv:1507.08754 [cs]}, number={arXiv:1507.08754}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Wu, Fa and Hu, Peijun and Kong, Dexing}, year={2015}, month=Jul }

In contrast to the popular notion of adversarial robustness, our model-agnostic corruptions do not seek worst-case performance but are instead designed to be broad and diverse, capturing multiple failure modes of modern models. In fact, we find that several previously published adversarial defenses significantly degrade robustness as measured by MNIST-C.

The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods.

However, complex network architectures challenge efficient real-time deployment and require significant computation resources and energy costs. These challenges can be overcome through optimizations such as network compression. Network compression can often be realized with little loss of accuracy. In some cases accuracy may even improve. This paper provides a survey on two types of network compression: pruning and quantization. Pruning can be categorized as static if it is performed offline or dynamic if it is performed at run-time. We compare pruning techniques and describe criteria used to remove redundant computations. We discuss trade-offs in element-wise, channel-wise, shape-wise, filter-wise, layer-wise and even network-wise pruning. Quantization reduces computations by reducing the precision of the datatype. Weights, biases, and activations may be quantized typically to 8-bit integers although lower bit width implementations are also discussed including binary neural networks.

The recent success of deep networks in machine learning and AI, however, has inspired proposals for understanding how the brain might learn across multiple layers, and hence how it might approximate BP. As of yet, none of these proposals have been rigorously evaluated on tasks where BP-guided deep learning has proved critical, or in architectures more structured than simple fully-connected networks. Here we present results on scaling up biologically motivated models of deep learning on datasets which need deep networks with appropriate architectures to achieve good performance. We present results on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet datasets and explore variants of target-propagation (TP) and feedback alignment (FA) algorithms, and explore performance in both fully- and locally-connected architectures. We also introduce weight-transport-free variants of difference target propagation (DTP) modified to remove backpropagation from the penultimate layer. Many of these algorithms perform well for MNIST, but for CIFAR and ImageNet we find that TP and FA variants perform significantly worse than BP, especially for networks composed of locally connected units, opening questions about whether new architectures and algorithms are required to scale these approaches.

This deep architecture is representationally powerful, but it complicates learning by making it hard to identify the responsible neurons when a mistake is made. In machine learning, the backpropagation algorithm assigns blame to a neuron by computing exactly how it contributed to an error. To do this, it multiplies error signals by matrices consisting of all the synaptic weights on the neuron’s axon and farther downstream. This operation requires a precisely choreographed transport of synaptic weight information, which is thought to be impossible in the brain. Here we present a surprisingly simple algorithm for deep learning, which assigns blame by multiplying error signals by random synaptic weights. We show that a network can learn to extract useful information from signals sent through these random feedback connections. In essence, the network learns to learn. We demonstrate that this new mechanism performs as quickly and accurately as backpropagation on a variety of problems and describe the principles which underlie its function. Our demonstration provides a plausible basis for how a neuron can be adapted using error signals generated at distal locations in the brain, and thus dispels long-held assumptions about the algorithmic constraints on learning in neural circuits.}, note={arXiv:1411.0247 [cs, q-bio]}, number={arXiv:1411.0247}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Lillicrap, Timothy P. and Cownden, Daniel and Tweed, Douglas B. and Akerman, Colin J.}, year={2014}, month=Nov }

A version of BP that can be computed locally using bidirectional activation recirculation (Hinton and McClelland 1988) instead of backpropagated error derivatives is more biologically plausible. This paper presents a generalized version of the recirculation algorithm (GeneRec), which overcomes several limitations of the earlier algorithm by using a generic recurrent network with sigmoidal units that can learn arbitrary input/output mappings. However, the contrastive Hebbian learning algorithm (CHL, also known as DBM or mean field learning) also uses local variables to perform error-driven learning in a sigmoidal recurrent network. CHL was derived in a stochastic framework (the Boltzmann machine), but has been extended to the deterministic case in various ways, all of which rely on problematic approximations and assumptions, leading some to conclude that it is fundamentally flawed. This paper shows that CHL can be derived instead from within the BP framework via the GeneRec algorithm. CHL is a symmetry-preserving version of GeneRec that uses a simple approximation to the midpoint or second-order accurate Runge-Kutta method of numerical integration, which explains the generally faster learning speed of CHL compared to BI. Thus, all known fully general error-driven learning algorithms that use local activation-based variables in deterministic networks can be considered variations of the GeneRec algorithm (and indirectly, of the backpropagation algorithm). GeneRec therefore provides a promising framework for thinking about how the brain might perform error-driven learning. To further this goal, an explicit biological mechanism is proposed that would be capable of implementing GeneRec-style learning. This mechanism is consistent with available evidence regarding synaptic modification in neurons in the neocortex and hippocampus, and makes further predictions.}, number={5}, journal={Neural Computation}, author={O’Reilly, Randall C.}, year={1996}, month=Jul, pages={895–938}, language={en} }

This lack of invariance is attributed to the use of stride which ignores the sampling theorem, and fully connected layers which lack spatial reasoning. We show that stride can greatly benefit translation invariance given that it is combined with sufficient similarity between neighbouring pixels, a characteristic which we refer to as local homogeneity. We also observe that this characteristic is dataset-specific and dictates the relationship between pooling kernel size and stride required for translation invariance. Furthermore we find that a trade-off exists between generalization and translation invariance in the case of pooling kernel size, as larger kernel sizes lead to better invariance but poorer generalization. Finally we explore the efficacy of other solutions proposed, namely global average pooling, anti-aliasing, and data augmentation, both empirically and through the lens of local homogeneity.}, note={arXiv:2103.10097 [cs]}, author={Mouton, Coenraad and Myburgh, Johannes C. and Davel, Marelie H.}, year={2020}, pages={267–281} }

This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9% top-5 validation error (and 4.8% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.}, note={arXiv:1502.03167 [cs]}, number={arXiv:1502.03167}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Ioffe, Sergey and Szegedy, Christian}, year={2015}, month=Mar }

Prior work on object detection repurposes classifiers to perform detection.

A single neural network predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation. Since the whole detection pipeline is a single network, it can be optimized end-to-end directly on detection performance. Our unified architecture is extremely fast. Our base YOLO model processes images in real-time at 45 frames per second. A smaller version of the network, Fast YOLO, processes an astounding 155 frames per second while still achieving double the mAP of other real-time detectors. Compared to state-of-the-art detection systems, YOLO makes more localization errors but is far less likely to predict false detections where nothing exists.

Before eye-opening, the visual cortex is largely devoid of sensory inputs and neuronal activities are generated intrinsically. After eye-opening, the cortex starts to integrate visual information. Here we used in vivo two-photon calcium imaging to explore the developmental changes of the mouse visual cortex by analyzing the ongoing spontaneous activity. We found that before eye-opening, the activity of layer 2/3 neurons consists predominantly of slow wave oscillations. These waves were first detected at postnatal day 8 (P8). Their initial very low frequency (0.01 Hz) gradually increased during development to ≈0.5 Hz in adults. Before eye-opening, a large fraction of neurons (>75%) was active during each wave. One day after eye-opening, this dense mode of recruitment changed to a sparse mode with only 36% of active neurons per wave. This was followed by a progressive decrease during the following weeks, reaching 12% of active neurons per wave in adults. The possible role of visual experience for this process of sparsification was investigated by analyzing dark-reared mice. We found that sparsification also occurred in these mice, but that the switch from a dense to a sparse activity pattern was delayed by 3–4 days as compared with normally-reared mice. These results reveal a modulatory contribution of visual experience during the first days after eye-opening, but an overall dominating role of intrinsic factors. We propose that the transformation in network activity from dense to sparse is a prerequisite for the changed cortical function at eye-opening.}, number={35}, journal={Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences}, author={Rochefort, Nathalie L. and Garaschuk, Olga and Milos, Ruxandra-Iulia and Narushima, Madoka and Marandi, Nima and Pichler, Bruno and Kovalchuk, Yury and Konnerth, Arthur}, year={2009}, month=Sep, pages={15049–15054}, language={en} }

 @article{Louizos_Welling_Kingma_2018, title={Learning Sparse Neural Networks through $L_0$ Regularization}, url={http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01312}, abstractNote={We propose a practical method for $L_0$ norm regularization for neural networks: pruning the network during training by encouraging weights to become exactly zero. Such regularization is interesting since (1) it can greatly speed up training and inference, and (2) it can improve generalization. AIC and BIC, well-known model selection criteria, are special cases of $L_0$ regularization. However, since the $L_0$ norm of weights is non-differentiable, we cannot incorporate it directly as a regularization term in the objective function. We propose a solution through the inclusion of a collection of non-negative stochastic gates, which collectively determine which weights to set to zero. We show that, somewhat surprisingly, for certain distributions over the gates, the expected $L_0$ norm of the resulting gated weights is differentiable with respect to the distribution parameters. We further propose the emph{hard concrete} distribution for the gates, which is obtained by “stretching” a binary concrete distribution and then transforming its samples with a hard-sigmoid. The parameters of the distribution over the gates can then be jointly optimized with the original network parameters. As a result our method allows for straightforward and efficient learning of model structures with stochastic gradient descent and allows for conditional computation in a principled way.

Similarly to their biological counterparts, sparse networks generalize just as well, if not better than, the original dense networks. Sparsity can reduce the memory footprint of regular networks to fit mobile devices, as well as shorten training time for ever growing networks. In this paper, we survey prior work on sparsity in deep learning and provide an extensive tutorial of sparsification for both inference and training. We describe approaches to remove and add elements of neural networks, different training strategies to achieve model sparsity, and mechanisms to exploit sparsity in practice. Our work distills ideas from more than 300 research papers and provides guidance to practitioners who wish to utilize sparsity today, as well as to researchers whose goal is to push the frontier forward. We include the necessary background on mathematical methods in sparsification, describe phenomena such as early structure adaptation, the intricate relations between sparsity and the training process, and show techniques for achieving acceleration on real hardware.

To replace the time and memory consuming dilated convolutions, we propose a novel joint upsampling module named Joint Pyramid Upsampling (JPU) by formulating the task of extracting high-resolution feature maps into a joint upsampling problem. With the proposed JPU, our method reduces the computation complexity by more than three times without performance loss. Experiments show that JPU is superior to other upsampling modules, which can be plugged into many existing approaches to reduce computation complexity and improve performance. By replacing dilated convolutions with the proposed JPU module, our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance in Pascal Context dataset (mIoU of 53.13%) and ADE20K dataset (final score of 0.5584) while running 3 times faster.}, note={arXiv:1903.11816 [cs]}, number={arXiv:1903.11816}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Wu, Huikai and Zhang, Junge and Huang, Kaiqi and Liang, Kongming and Yu, Yizhou}, year={2019}, month=Mar }

In spite of their fundamental role, only linear autoencoders over the real numbers have been solved analytically. Here we present a general mathematical framework for the study of both linear and non-linear autoencoders. The framework allows one to derive an analytical treatment for the most non-linear autoencoder, the Boolean autoencoder. Learning in the Boolean autoencoder is equivalent to a clustering problem that can be solved in polynomial time when the number of clusters is small and becomes NP complete when the number of clusters is large. The framework sheds light on the different kinds of autoencoders, their learning complexity, their horizontal and vertical composability in deep architectures, their critical points, and their fundamental connections to clustering, Hebbian learning, and information theory.}

This approach can be used to train autoencoders, and these denoising autoencoders can be stacked to initialize deep architectures.

We show that by adding a well chosen penalty term to the classical reconstruction cost function, we can achieve results that equal or surpass those attained by other regularized auto-encoders as well as denoising auto-encoders on a range of datasets. This penalty term corresponds to the Frobenius norm of the Jacobian matrix of the encoder activations with respect to the input. We show that this penalty term results in a localized space contraction which in turn yields robust features on the activation layer. Furthermore, we show how this penalty term is related to both regularized auto-encoders and denoising auto-encoders and how it can be seen as a link between deterministic and non-deterministic auto-encoders. We find empirically that this penalty helps to carve a representation that better captures the local directions of variation dictated by the data, corresponding to a lower-dimensional non-linear manifold, while being more invariant to the vast majority of directions orthogonal to the manifold. Finally, we show that by using the learned features to initialize a MLP, we achieve state of the art classification error on a range of datasets, surpassing other methods of pretraining.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on International Conference on Machine Learning}, pages = {833–840}, numpages = {8}, location = {Bellevue, Washington, USA}, series = {ICML'11} }

Previous theoretical (Feldman and Ballard 1982; Durbin and Rumelhart 1989; Mel 1990; Mel and Koch 1990; Poggio and Girosi 1990) and compartmental modeling (Koch et al. 1983; Shepherd et al. 1985; Koch and Poggio 1987; Rall and Segev 1987; Shepherd and Brayton 1987; Shepherd et al. 1989; Brown et al. 1991) work had suggested that multiplicative interactions among groups of neighboring synapses could greatly enhance the processing power of a neuron relative to a unit with only a single global firing threshold. This issue was investigated here, with a particular focus on the role of voltage-dependent N-methyl-D-asparate (NMDA) channels in the generation of cell responses. First, it was found that when a large proportion of the excitatory synaptic input to dendritic spines is carried by NMDA channels, the pyramidal cell responds preferentially to spatially clustered, rather than random, distributions of activated synapses. Second, based on this mechanism, the NMDA-rich neuron is shown to be capable of solving a nonlinear pattern discrimination task. We propose that manipulation of the spatial ordering of afferent synaptic connections onto the dendritic arbor is a possible biological strategy for pattern information storage during learning.}, number={4}, journal={Neural Computation}, author={Mel, Bartlett W.}, year={1992}, month=Jul, pages={502–517}, language={en} }

The key ingredient is a new smoothness condition derived from practical neural network training examples. We observe that gradient smoothness, a concept central to the analysis of first-order optimization algorithms that is often assumed to be a constant, demonstrates significant variability along the training trajectory of deep neural networks. Further, this smoothness positively correlates with the gradient norm, and contrary to standard assumptions in the literature, it can grow with the norm of the gradient. These empirical observations limit the applicability of existing theoretical analyses of algorithms that rely on a fixed bound on smoothness. These observations motivate us to introduce a novel relaxation of gradient smoothness that is weaker than the commonly used Lipschitz smoothness assumption. Under the new condition, we prove that two popular methods, namely, emph{gradient clipping} and emph{normalized gradient}, converge arbitrarily faster than gradient descent with fixed stepsize. We further explain why such adaptively scaled gradient methods can accelerate empirical convergence and verify our results empirically in popular neural network training settings.}, note={arXiv:1905.11881 [cs, math]}, number={arXiv:1905.11881}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Zhang, Jingzhao and He, Tianxing and Sra, Suvrit and Jadbabaie, Ali}, year={2020}, month=Feb }

We focus our attention on three aspects of traditional convolutional-neural-network-type (CNN-type) architectures:  (1) transparency in the effect intermediate layers have on overall classification;  (2) discriminativeness and robustness of learned features, especially in early layers;  (3) training effectiveness in the face of “vanishing” gradients.  To combat these issues, we introduce “companion” objective functions at each hidden layer, in addition to the overall objective function at the output layer (an integrated strategy distinct from layer-wise pre-training). We also analyze our algorithm using techniques extended from stochastic gradient methods. The advantages provided by our method are evident in our experimental results, showing state-of-the-art performance on MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN.}

In terms of the models, we present a principled method to “kernelize” (partly or completely) any neural network (NN). With this method, we obtain a counterpart of any given NN that is powered by kernel machines instead of neurons. In terms of learning, when learning a feedforward deep architecture in a supervised setting, one needs to train all the components simultaneously using backpropagation (BP) since there are no explicit targets for the hidden layers (Rumelhart, Hinton, & Williams, 1986 ). We consider without loss of generality the two-layer case and present a general framework that explicitly characterizes a target for the hidden layer that is optimal for minimizing the objective function of the network. This characterization then makes possible a purely greedy training scheme that learns one layer at a time, starting from the input layer. We provide instantiations of the abstract framework under certain architectures and objective functions. Based on these instantiations, we present a layer-wise training algorithm for an [Formula: see text]-layer feedforward network for classification, where [Formula: see text] can be arbitrary. This algorithm can be given an intuitive geometric interpretation that makes the learning dynamics transparent. Empirical results are provided to complement our theory. We show that the kernelized networks, trained layer-wise, compare favorably with classical kernel machines as well as other connectionist models trained by BP. We also visualize the inner workings of the greedy kernelized models to validate our claim on the transparency of the layer-wise algorithm.}, number={1}, journal={Neural Computation}, author={Duan, Shiyu and Yu, Shujian and Chen, Yunmei and Principe, Jose C.}, year={2020}, month=Jan, pages={97–135}, language={en} }

 @article{Wang_Ni_Song_Yang_Huang_2021, title={Revisiting Locally Supervised Learning: an Alternative to End-to-end Training}, url={http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.10832}, abstractNote={Due to the need to store the intermediate activations for back-propagation, end-to-end (E2E) training of deep networks usually suffers from high GPUs memory footprint. This paper aims to address this problem by revisiting the locally supervised learning, where a network is split into gradient-isolated modules and trained with local supervision. We experimentally show that simply training local modules with E2E loss tends to collapse task-relevant information at early layers, and hence hurts the performance of the full model. To avoid this issue, we propose an information propagation (InfoPro) loss, which encourages local modules to preserve as much useful information as possible, while progressively discard task-irrelevant information. As InfoPro loss is difficult to compute in its original form, we derive a feasible upper bound as a surrogate optimization objective, yielding a simple but effective algorithm. In fact, we show that the proposed method boils down to minimizing the combination of a reconstruction loss and a normal cross-entropy/contrastive term. Extensive empirical results on five datasets (i.e., CIFAR, SVHN, STL-10, ImageNet and Cityscapes) validate that InfoPro is capable of achieving competitive performance with less than 40% memory footprint compared to E2E training, while allowing using training data with higher-resolution or larger batch sizes under the same GPU memory constraint. Our method also enables training local modules asynchronously for potential training acceleration.

An alternative approach is to train the network with layer-wise loss functions. In this paper we demonstrate, for the first time, that layer-wise training can approach the state-of-the-art on a variety of image datasets. We use single-layer sub-networks and two different supervised loss functions to generate local error signals for the hidden layers, and we show that the combination of these losses help with optimization in the context of local learning. Using local errors could be a step towards more biologically plausible deep learning because the global error does not have to be transported back to hidden layers. A completely backprop free variant outperforms previously reported results among methods aiming for higher biological plausibility.}

Several alternatives that can alleviate this issue have been proposed. In this context, we consider a simpler, but more effective, substitute that uses minimal feedback, which we call Decoupled Greedy Learning (DGL). It is based on a greedy relaxation of the joint training objective, recently shown to be effective in the context of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on large-scale image classification. We consider an optimization of this objective that permits us to decouple the layer training, allowing for layers or modules in networks to be trained with a potentially linear parallelization in layers. With the use of a replay buffer we show this approach can be extended to asynchronous settings, where modules can operate with possibly large communication delays. We show theoretically and empirically that this approach converges. Then, we empirically find that it can lead to better generalization than sequential greedy optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DGL against alternative approaches on the CIFAR-10 dataset and on the large-scale ImageNet dataset.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 37th International Conference on Machine Learning}, articleno = {69}, numpages = {10}, series = {ICML'20} }

 @article{Bengio_2014, title={How Auto-Encoders Could Provide Credit Assignment in Deep Networks via Target Propagation}, url={http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.7906}, abstractNote={We propose to exploit {em reconstruction} as a layer-local training signal for deep learning. Reconstructions can be propagated in a form of target propagation playing a role similar to back-propagation but helping to reduce the reliance on derivatives in order to perform credit assignment across many levels of possibly strong non-linearities (which is difficult for back-propagation). A regularized auto-encoder tends produce a reconstruction that is a more likely version of its input, i.e., a small move in the direction of higher likelihood. By generalizing gradients, target propagation may also allow to train deep networks with discrete hidden units. If the auto-encoder takes both a representation of input and target (or of any side information) in input, then its reconstruction of input representation provides a target towards a representation that is more likely, conditioned on all the side information. A deep auto-encoder decoding path generalizes gradient propagation in a learned way that can could thus handle not just infinitesimal changes but larger, discrete changes, hopefully allowing credit assignment through a long chain of non-linear operations. In addition to each layer being a good auto-encoder, the encoder also learns to please the upper layers by transforming the data into a space where it is easier to model by them, flattening manifolds and disentangling factors. The motivations and theoretical justifications for this approach are laid down in this paper, along with conjectures that will have to be verified either mathematically or experimentally, including a hypothesis stating that such auto-encoder mediated target propagation could play in brains the role of credit assignment through many non-linear, noisy and discrete transformations.}, note={arXiv:1407.7906 [cs]}, number={arXiv:1407.7906}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Bengio, Yoshua}, year={2014}, month=Sep }

Furthermore, our analysis reveals a fundamental limitation of difference target propagation (DTP), a well-known variant of TP, in the realistic scenario of non-invertible neural networks. We provide a first solution to this problem through a novel reconstruction loss that improves feedback weight training, while simultaneously introducing architectural flexibility by allowing for direct feedback connections from the output to each hidden layer.

  abstract = 	 {Training directed neural networks typically requires forward-propagating data through a computation graph, followed by backpropagating error signal, to produce weight updates. All layers, or more generally, modules, of the network are therefore locked, in the sense that they must wait for the remainder of the network to execute forwards and propagate error backwards before they can be updated. In this work we break this constraint by decoupling modules by introducing a model of the future computation of the network graph. These models predict what the result of the modelled subgraph will produce using only local information. In particular we focus on modelling error gradients: by using the modelled <em>synthetic gradient</em> in place of true backpropagated error gradients we decouple subgraphs, and can update them independently and asynchronously i.e. we realise <em>decoupled neural interfaces</em>. We show results for feed-forward models, where every layer is trained asynchronously, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) where predicting one’s future gradient extends the time over which the RNN can effectively model, and also a hierarchical RNN system with ticking at different timescales. Finally, we demonstrate that in addition to predicting gradients, the same framework can be used to predict inputs, resulting in models which are decoupled in both the forward and backwards pass – amounting to independent networks which co-learn such that they can be composed into a single functioning corporation.}

However, there has been very little demonstration of what changes DNIs and SGs impose from a functional, representational, and learning dynamics point of view. In this paper, we study DNIs through the use of synthetic gradients on feed-forward networks to better understand their behaviour and elucidate their effect on optimisation. We show that the incorporation of SGs does not affect the representational strength of the learning system for a neural network, and prove the convergence of the learning system for linear and deep linear models.

However, despite extensive research, it remains unclear if the brain implements this algorithm. Among neuroscientists, reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are often seen as a realistic alternative: neurons can randomly introduce change, and use unspecific feedback signals to observe their effect on the cost and thus approximate their gradient. However, the convergence rate of such learning scales poorly with the number of involved neurons. Here we propose a hybrid learning approach. Each neuron uses an RL-type strategy to learn how to approximate the gradients that backpropagation would provide. We provide proof that our approach converges to the true gradient for certain classes of networks. In both feedforward and convolutional networks, we empirically show that our approach learns to approximate the gradient, and can match or the performance of exact gradient-based learning.

One of the main reasons is that BP requires symmetric weight matrices in the feedforward and feedback pathways. To address this “weight transport problem” (Grossberg, 1987), two biologically-plausible algorithms, pro- posed by Liao et al. (2016) and Lillicrap et al. (2016), relax BP’s weight sym- metry requirements and demonstrate comparable learning capabilities to that of BP on small datasets. However, a recent study by Bartunov et al. (2018) finds that although feedback alignment (FA) and some variants of target-propagation (TP) perform well on MNIST and CIFAR, they perform significantly worse than BP on ImageNet. Here, we additionally evaluate the sign-symmetry (SS) algo- rithm (Liao et al., 2016), which differs from both BP and FA in that the feedback and feedforward weights do not share magnitudes but share signs. We examined the performance of sign-symmetry and feedback alignment on ImageNet and MS COCO datasets using different network architectures (ResNet-18 and AlexNet for ImageNet; RetinaNet for MS COCO). Surprisingly, networks trained with sign- symmetry can attain classification performance approaching that of BP-trained networks. These results complement the study by Bartunov et al.

  abstract = 	 {Intelligent processing of complex signals such as images is often performed by a hierarchy of nonlinear processing layers, such as a deep net or an object recognition cascade. Joint estimation of the parameters of all the layers is a difficult nonconvex optimization. We describe a general strategy to learn the parameters and, to some extent, the architecture of nested systems, which we call the method of auxiliary coordinates (MAC). This replaces the original problem involving a deeply nested function with a constrained problem involving a different function in an augmented space without nesting. The constrained problem may be solved with penalty-based methods using alternating optimization over the parameters and the auxiliary coordinates. MAC has provable convergence, is easy to implement reusing existing algorithms for single layers, can be parallelized trivially and massively, applies even when parameter derivatives are not available or not desirable, can perform some model selection on the fly, and is competitive with state-of-the-art nonlinear optimizers even in the serial computation setting, often providing reasonable models within a few iterations.}

This is largely because conventional optimization algorithms rely on stochastic gradient methods that don't scale well to large numbers of cores in a cluster setting.

This paper explores an unconventional training method that uses alternating direction methods and Bregman iteration to train networks without gradient descent steps. The proposed method reduces the network training problem to a sequence of minimization substeps that can each be solved globally in closed form.

Modular training refers to strictly local training without both the forward and the backward pass, i.e., dividing a deep architecture into several nonoverlapping modules and training them separately without any end-to-end operation. Between the fully global E2EBP and the strictly local modular training, there are weakly modular hybrids performing training without the backward pass only. These alternatives can match or surpass the performance of E2EBP on challenging datasets such as ImageNet, and are gaining increasing attention primarily because they offer practical advantages over E2EBP, which will be enumerated herein. In particular, they allow for greater modularity and transparency in deep learning workflows, aligning deep learning with the mainstream computer science engineering that heavily exploits modularization for scalability. Modular training has also revealed novel insights about learning and has further implications on other important research domains.

We introduce a conditional neural process based approach to the multi-task classification setting for this purpose, and establish connections to the meta-learning and few-shot learning literature. The resulting approach, called CNAPS, comprises a classifier whose parameters are modulated by an adaptation network that takes the current task's dataset as input. We demonstrate that CNAPS achieves state-of-the-art results on the challenging META-DATASET benchmark indicating high-quality transfer-learning. We show that the approach is robust, avoiding both over-fitting in low-shot regimes and under-fitting in high-shot regimes. Timing experiments reveal that CNAPS is computationally efficient at test-time as it does not involve gradient based adaptation. Finally, we show that trained models are immediately deployable to continual learning and active learning where they can outperform existing approaches that do not leverage transfer learning.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 33rd International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems}, articleno = {715}, numpages = {12} }

 @article{Ha_Dai_Le_2016, title={HyperNetworks}, url={http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09106}, abstractNote={This work explores hypernetworks: an approach of using a one network, also known as a hypernetwork, to generate the weights for another network. Hypernetworks provide an abstraction that is similar to what is found in nature: the relationship between a genotype - the hypernetwork - and a phenotype - the main network. Though they are also reminiscent of HyperNEAT in evolution, our hypernetworks are trained end-to-end with backpropagation and thus are usually faster. The focus of this work is to make hypernetworks useful for deep convolutional networks and long recurrent networks, where hypernetworks can be viewed as relaxed form of weight-sharing across layers. Our main result is that hypernetworks can generate non-shared weights for LSTM and achieve near state-of-the-art results on a variety of sequence modelling tasks including character-level language modelling, handwriting generation and neural machine translation, challenging the weight-sharing paradigm for recurrent networks. Our results also show that hypernetworks applied to convolutional networks still achieve respectable results for image recognition tasks compared to state-of-the-art baseline models while requiring fewer learnable parameters.}, note={arXiv:1609.09106 [cs]}, number={arXiv:1609.09106}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Ha, David and Dai, Andrew and Le, Quoc V.}, year={2016}, month=Dec }

For training large scale neural networks, we decompose the curvature matrix into smaller matrices in a novel scheme where we capture the dependencies of the model’s parameters with a series of tensor products. We demonstrate the effects of our proposed method on several few-shot learning tasks and datasets. Without any task specific techniques and architectures, the proposed method achieves substantial improvement upon previous MAML variants and outperforms the recent state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we observe faster convergence rates of the meta-training process.

While significant progress has been made, the growing complexity of network designs, meta-learning algorithms, and differences in implementation details make a fair comparison difficult. In this paper, we present 1) a consistent comparative analysis of several representative few-shot classification algorithms, with results showing that deeper backbones significantly reduce the performance differences among methods on datasets with limited domain differences, 2) a modified baseline method that surprisingly achieves competitive performance when compared with the state-of-the-art on both the miniI and the CUB datasets, and 3) a new experimental setting for evaluating the cross-domain generalization ability for few-shot classification algorithms. Our results reveal that reducing intra-class variation is an important factor when the feature backbone is shallow, but not as critical when using deeper backbones.

We show that an approximate version of the bilevel problem can be solved by taking into explicit account the optimization dynamics for the inner objective. Depending on the specific setting, the outer variables take either the meaning of hyperparameters in a supervised learning problem or parameters of a meta-learner. We provide sufficient conditions under which solutions of the approximate problem converge to those of the exact problem. We instantiate our approach for meta-learning in the case of deep learning where representation layers are treated as hyperparameters shared across a set of training episodes. In experiments, we confirm our theoretical findings, present encouraging results for few-shot learning and contrast the bilevel approach against classical approaches for learning-to-learn.}

 @article{Micaelli_Storkey_2021, title={Gradient-based Hyperparameter Optimization Over Long Horizons}, url={http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07869}, abstractNote={Gradient-based hyperparameter optimization has earned a widespread popularity in the context of few-shot meta-learning, but remains broadly impractical for tasks with long horizons (many gradient steps), due to memory scaling and gradient degradation issues. A common workaround is to learn hyperparameters online, but this introduces greediness which comes with a significant performance drop. We propose forward-mode differentiation with sharing (FDS), a simple and efficient algorithm which tackles memory scaling issues with forward-mode differentiation, and gradient degradation issues by sharing hyperparameters that are contiguous in time. We provide theoretical guarantees about the noise reduction properties of our algorithm, and demonstrate its efficiency empirically by differentiating through $sim 10^4$ gradient steps of unrolled optimization. We consider large hyperparameter search ranges on CIFAR-10 where we significantly outperform greedy gradient-based alternatives, while achieving $times 20$ speedups compared to the state-of-the-art black-box methods.

However, most of this success is limited to simulation. While there are promising successes in applying RL algorithms directly on real systems, their performance on more complex systems remains bottle-necked by the relative data inefficiency of RL algorithms. Domain randomization is a promising direction of research that has demonstrated impressive results using RL algorithms to control real robots. At a high level, domain randomization works by training a policy on a distribution of environmental conditions in simulation. If the environments are diverse enough, then the policy trained on this distribution will plausibly generalize to the real world. A human-specified design choice in domain randomization is the form and parameters of the distribution of simulated environments. It is unclear how to the best pick the form and parameters of this distribution and prior work uses hand-tuned distributions. This extended abstract demonstrates that the choice of the distribution plays a major role in the performance of the trained policies in the real world and that the parameter of this distribution can be optimized to maximize the performance of the trained policies in the real world}, note={arXiv:1903.11774 [cs, stat]}, number={arXiv:1903.11774}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Vuong, Quan and Vikram, Sharad and Su, Hao and Gao, Sicun and Christensen, Henrik I.}, year={2019}, month=Mar }

In contrast, animals can learn new tasks in just a few trials, benefiting from their prior knowledge about the world. This paper seeks to bridge this gap. Rather than designing a “fast” reinforcement learning algorithm, we propose to represent it as a recurrent neural network (RNN) and learn it from data. In our proposed method, RL$^2$, the algorithm is encoded in the weights of the RNN, which are learned slowly through a general-purpose (“slow”) RL algorithm. The RNN receives all information a typical RL algorithm would receive, including observations, actions, rewards, and termination flags; and it retains its state across episodes in a given Markov Decision Process (MDP). The activations of the RNN store the state of the “fast” RL algorithm on the current (previously unseen) MDP. We evaluate RL$^2$ experimentally on both small-scale and large-scale problems. On the small-scale side, we train it to solve randomly generated multi-arm bandit problems and finite MDPs. After RL$^2$ is trained, its performance on new MDPs is close to human-designed algorithms with optimality guarantees. On the large-scale side, we test RL$^2$ on a vision-based navigation task and show that it scales up to high-dimensional problems.}, note={arXiv:1611.02779 [cs, stat]}, number={arXiv:1611.02779}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Duan, Yan and Schulman, John and Chen, Xi and Bartlett, Peter L. and Sutskever, Ilya and Abbeel, Pieter}, year={2016}, month=Nov }

Two of the primary barriers to its adoption are an inability to scale to larger problems and a limited ability to generalize to new tasks. We introduce a learned gradient descent optimizer that generalizes well to new tasks, and which has significantly reduced memory and computation overhead. We achieve this by introducing a novel hierarchical RNN architecture, with minimal per-parameter overhead, augmented with additional architectural features that mirror the known structure of optimization tasks. We also develop a meta-training ensemble of small, diverse, optimization tasks capturing common properties of loss landscapes. The optimizer learns to outperform RMSProp/ADAM on problems in this corpus. More importantly, it performs comparably or better when applied to small convolutional neural networks, despite seeing no neural networks in its meta-training set. Finally, it generalizes to train Inception V3 and ResNet V2 architectures on the ImageNet dataset for thousands of steps, optimization problems that are of a vastly different scale than those it was trained on.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 34th International Conference on Machine Learning - Volume 70}, pages = {3751–3760}, numpages = {10}, location = {Sydney, NSW, Australia}, series = {ICML'17} }

We briefly review Hochreiter’s (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.}, number={8}, journal={Neural Computation}, author={Hochreiter, Sepp and Schmidhuber, Jürgen}, year={1997}, month={Nov}, pages={1735–1780}, language={en} }

@article{Willshaw_VonDerMalsburg_1979, title={A marker induction mechanism for the establishment of ordered neural mappings: its application to the retinotectal problem}, volume={287}, ISSN={0080-4622, 2054-0280}, DOI={10.1098/rstb.1979.0056}, abstractNote={This paper examines the idea that ordered patterns of nerve connections are set up by means of markers carried by the individual cells. The case of the ordered retinotectal projection in amphibia and fishes is discussed in great detail. It is suggested that retinotectal mappings are the result of two mechanisms acting in concert. One mechanism induces a set of retinal markers into the tectum. By this means, an initially haphazard pattern of synapses is transformed into a continuous or piece-wise continuous projection. The other mechanism places the individual pieces of the map in the correct orientation. The machinery necessary for this inductive scheme has been expressed in terms of a set of differential equations, which have been solved numerically for a number of cases. Straightforward assumptions are made as to how markers are distributed in the retina; how they are induced into the tectum; and how the induced markers bring about alterations in the pattern of synaptic contacts. A detailed physiological interpretation of the model is given. The inductive mechanism has been formulated at the level of the individual synaptic interactions. Therefore, it is possible to specify, in a given situation, not only the nature of the end state of the mapping but also how the mapping develops over time. The role of the modes of growth of retina and tectum in shaping the developing projection becomes clear. Since, on this model, the tectum is initially devoid of markers, there is an important difference between the development and the regeneration of ordered mappings. In the development of duplicate maps from various types of compound-eyes, it is suggested that the tectum, rather than the retina, contains an abnormal distribution of markers. An important parameter in these experiments, and also in the regeneration experiments where part-duplication has been found, is the range of interaction amongst the retinal cells. It is suggested that the results of many of the regeneration experiments (including apparently contradictory ones) are manifestations of a conflict between the two alternative ways of specifying the orientation of the map: through the information carried by the markers previously induced into the tectum and through the orientation mechanism itself.}, number={1021}, journal={Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

Neural implementation of this may be based on preorganized fiber projections that can be activated rapidly with the help of control units (Wolfrum, Wolff, Lücke, & von der Malsburg, 2008 ). Each control unit governs a set of projection fibers that form part of a coherent mapping. We describe a mathematical model for the ontogenesis of the underlying connectivity based on a principle of network self-organization as described by the Häussler system (Häussler & von der Malsburg, 1983 ), modified to be sensitive to pattern similarity and to support formation of multiple mappings, each under the command of a control unit. The process takes the form of a soft-winner-take-all, where units compete for the representation of maps. We show simulations for invariant point-to-point and feature-to-feature mappings.}, number={5}, journal={Neural Computation}, author={Fernandes, Tomas and {von der Malsburg}, Christoph}, year={2015}, month={May}, pages={1005–1032}, language={en} }

It is a crucial issue to embed super-pixel images from lowdimensional to high-dimensional so as to turn complex image information into graph signals. This paper proposes a method for image classification using a graph neural network (GNN) model. We convert the input image into a region adjacency graph (RAG) composed of superpixels as nodes, and use residual and concat structure to extract deep features. Finally, the loss function that increases the distance between classes and compactness within classes is used as supervision. Experiments have been tested with different numbers of superpixels on multiple datasets, and the results show that our method has a great performance in superpixel images classification.}, number={1}, journal={Journal of Physics: Conference Series}, author={Long, Jianwu and yan, Zeran and chen, Hongfa}, year={2021}, month={Apr}, pages={012071} }

Through several experiments and visualizations we demonstrate that our corruptions significantly degrade performance of state-of-the-art computer vision models while preserving the semantic content of the test images. In contrast to the popular notion of adversarial robustness, our model-agnostic corruptions do not seek worst-case performance but are instead designed to be broad and diverse, capturing multiple failure modes of modern models. In fact, we find that several previously published adversarial defenses significantly degrade robustness as measured by MNIST-C.
